      "content":"A giant emerald measuring 1.3 metres (4.3 feet) and weighing a whopping 360 kilograms (794 pounds) was discovered in April in the mining region of Carnaiba in the north of Brazil. The precious stone was found 200 metres (656 feet) below the surface of the Carnaiba mine in the Pindobacu district, by the Bahia Mineral Cooperative. The emerald was sold to an individual who refused to give an interview for security purposes, and did not reveal how much he had paid. The owner‚Äôs lawyer, Marcio Jandir, said all the relevant documentation for the sale had been completed. He said the owner was authorised to travel with the stone throughout Brazilian territory as he intended to present it at museums and libraries. The emerald is the second of its kind found in the region, following another discovered in 2001 which weighed 20 kilograms (44 pounds) and was valued at 310 million U.S.-dollars. The emerald was transported to the United States illegally and became the subject of a legal dispute between Brazil and the United States until it was decided in 2015 it would remain in the United States.

      "content":"Jose Mourinho‚Äôs first season at Manchester United will be deemed by many as a failure unless they win Wednesday‚Äôs Europa League final against Ajax Amsterdam to secure Champions League qualification.The Portuguese coach arrived at Old Trafford at the start of this campaign charged with the task of restoring United to, if not their old dominance, at least a place at the top table in the Premier League elite.But a sixth-place finish is lower than Mourinho‚Äôs predecessor Louis van Gaal managed in his two seasons, which concluded with fourth and fifth places.It is not the prestige of the Europa League title that would change the perspective on the former Chelsea and Real Madrid manager‚Äôs first year at United but the place that triumph would secure in the continent‚Äôs top club competition.For United, a second straight season outside the European elite would not only be a blow for the fans and the club‚Äôs status but could also affect their ability to recruit the very best talent from across the globe.For Mourinho, there is also his own ‚Äòbrand‚Äô to consider.The 54-year-old left Chelsea last season after a shocking campaign of under-achievement, only for largely the same group of players to march to the Premier League title this term under his replacement Italian Antonio Conte.",
